# The MENACE project
This is an implementation of a learning tic-tac-toe playing machine. See the notebook [MENACE_matchbox-educable-noughts-crosses-engine.ipynb](MENACE_matchbox-educable-noughts-crosses-engine.ipynb).

The Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine (MENACE) is a tic-tac-toe playing machine learning algorithm developed by Donald Michie in 1961. The original MENACE was built as a mechanical computer made of 304 matchboxes and a set of rules for learning. This is a Python implementation of the same logic that I worked on as a problem solving and learning exercise.  

- The project was inspired by this blogpost: [Underfitted, The Most Ridiculous Tic-Tac-Toe Machine](https://underfitted.svpino.com/p/the-most-ridiculous-tic-tac-toe-machine)  
- More info on the original MENACE can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matchbox_Educable_Noughts_and_Crosses_Engine).  
- Finding the possible states of the game is not trivial. This part a solution was copied from this repo https://github.com/vug/tic-tac-toe-game-states-graph and studied in the notebook [MENACE_understanding_possible_board_states.ipynb](MENACE_understanding_possible_board_states.ipynb)
